## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project, I got to learn about divs and its positionings better. CSS Flexbox still remains a struggle and I became more familiar with CSS media queries.

This was the easiest challenge of front-end mentor and it helped me get comfortable with basic building using html and css.


### Continued development

If you run this code and drag browser window to check responsiveness, then you shall notice that my div starts floating up or down and i can't keep it centered vertically. Please do help me out if you know how to, or with improvement suggestions in my noob code.
